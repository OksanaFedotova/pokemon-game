This is a training project realized with React. It is a card game.
In this card two players face off against one another, one side playing as "blue", the other as "red" on a 3x3 grid.
Each player has five cards in a hand and the aim is to capture the opponent's cards by turning them into the player's own color. To do it you need to put card with bigger number on the side bordering with opponent's card.
